# Viz

Simple cross platform image viewer (MacOS, Linux, Windows).

## Motivations

There is no good default image viewer for MacOS (you need to open images one by one using `Preview`).

## Getting started

`npm i`
Then in two separate terminals : <br>
`npm start`<br>
`npm run electron`

## Roadmap

In the [Projects section](./projects/1) of this repo.
